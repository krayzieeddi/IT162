    <span>What is school counseling?</span>
</div>

<p class="faqParagraph">
    School counseling is the support of students in educational 
    settings with a focus on academic, college and career readiness,
    as well as social-emotional support. School counseling is
    informed by the American School Counseling Association and 
    more information can be found at

<div class="question">
    <span>What's the difference between school counseling and therapy?</span>
</div>

<p class="faqParagraph">
    A therapy session typically lasts 50 minutes and occurs on a weekly basis 
    for an extended period of time. A school counselor has a caseload of 
    students (around 250) and works to develop interventions that will better 
    the educational experience of all students. School counselors meet 
    one-on-one with students who may need more intensive support, but not for
     an extended period of time on a regular basis.
