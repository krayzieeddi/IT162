            <h3>Bio</h3>

    <p>
        I was born and raised in Fresno, California, in a family that 
        valued education. Eventually, I decided to apply to graduate 
        schools that had exceptional school counseling programs. I 
        packed up and moved to Seattle to attend Seattle University. 
    </p>

    <p>
        I chose this program because I can identify with its mission 
        of being a diverse, ethical, multiculturally competent counselor 
        who is reflexive and has the clinical skills to help and support 
        students from Kindergarten to 12th grade.
    </p>

    <p>
        My passion is being an advocate, educator, and support for 
        students, families, communities who have been and continue to
        be disenfranchised by the education system. In todayâ€™s society 
        confronting injustices, especially those faced by school-aged 
        children and teenagers, should be a focus for all adults in 
        education. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Students should not have to worry about having to 
        fight for basic human rights and necessities while in school 
        and facing other obstacles. My commitment to social justice, 
        racial equity, access to education, and mental health is at the
        forefront of my work as a school counselor and will continue 
        to inform my future endeavors.
