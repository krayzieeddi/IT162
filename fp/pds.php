            <p class="question">Education and Training</p>
            <p>
                I received an Associate’s degree in Sociology from Fresno City
                 College and a Bachelor’s degree in Sociology from the University 
                 of California, Santa Barbara. I will graduate with a Master’s of 
                 Arts in Education in Counseling, with an emphasis in School 
                 Counseling from Seattle University in June 2021. The counseling 
                 program at Seattle University is accredited by the Council on 
                 Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education Programs (CACREP). 
                 In the past I have worked in K-12 school settings as an AVID tutor, 
                 teaching assistant, and volunteered at many school events. 
                 I completed my practicum at Dunlap Elementary School in Seattle 
                 Public Schools. I am currently completing my internship at 
                 Cleveland STEM High School in Seattle Public Schools.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am a member of the American School Counselor Association (ASCA)
                 as well as the Washington School Counselor Association (WSCA). 
                 As a school counselor, I follow the ASCA code of ethics as well 
                 as the American Counseling Association (ACA) code of ethics. 
                 Both codes of ethics serve as guides and inform school counselors
                  of how to best serve students, parents/guardians, and others. 
                  These codes of ethics also inform school counselors of what to 
                  do or how to go about solving ethical issues we may encounter. 
                  If you have any questions or concerns, I encourage you to reach 
                  out to discuss any questions or concerns you have with me.
            </p>

            <p class="question">Philosophy and Approach</p>
            <p>
                I believe that the role of a school counselor is to support 
                students and facilitate growth in the areas of social-emotional 
                health, academics, as well as college and career readiness. I 
                practice from an Integrative Therapy approach which allows me 
                to pull from and work with strategies and techniques from various 
                counseling theories and therapies. As a school counselor, I have 
                largely practiced from a strengths-based and solution-focused 
                approach as I have found these are beneficial to students and an 
                efficient use of our time together. However, what works well for 
                one student, may not work well with every student which is why I 
                understand the importance of working one-on-one with students.
            </p>

            <p class="question">School Counseling Services</p>
            <p>
                Referrals to a school counselor may be made by parents/guardians, 
                teachers and staff, community members the student is connected with.
                 Students can also refer themselves to their school counselor 
                 (self-referral). There is no fee for school counseling services. 
                 School Counselors offer academic, college/career and 
                 personal/social-emotional support for students which includes, 
                 but is not limited to:

            <p class="question">School Counseling Services</p>
            <p>
                School Counseling is based on a trusting relationship between 
                the school counselor and student. Information shared with me is 
                considered confidential and will not be shared with others, 
                except in certain situations where it is my ethical 
                responsibility to limit confidentiality and share relevant 
                information. Students and families will always be notified 
                of the limitations of confidentiality and when I must share 
                relevant information with others. The situations are when:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>A person is believed to be a danger to themself.</li>
                <li>A person is believed to be in danger of hurting someone else.</li>
                <li>A person is suspected of being abused, neglected, or abandoned.</li>
                <li>The school counselor's records are subpoenaed by court order.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                Referrals to outside agencies and information exchanged with outside 
                agencies will occur after receiving student and parent/guardian consent.
            </p>

            <p class="question">Consent</p>
            <p>
                By signing this form, you are stating you have read it, understand the 
                nature of school counseling, and understand that confidentiality is 
                necessary to counseling services and will be kept except in the already 
                stated situations.
            </p>
